<h1>The Route of All Evil</h1> 

<p>I guess because my parents keep telling me to
be more ladylike. As though!  Yep, I remember. They came in last at the
Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Hey, tell me something.
You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your
laundry? What are their names? You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when
you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in
space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?</p>

<h2>Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences</h2> 

<p>Whoa a real live robot; or is that
some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?  You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!
Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.</p> 

<ul>
<li>THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH,
FOR NO RAISEN!</li> 
<li>Large bet on myself in round one.</li> 
<li>I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat;
David Duchovny!</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Parasites Lost</h3> 

<p>I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where
it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Tell her you just want to talk. It
has nothing to do with mating. With gusto. I've got to find a way to escape the
horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork,
every three hours.  And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me
checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! Fetal stemcells, aren't those
controversial? Why would a robot need to drink?</p> 

<h4>Kif Gets Knocked Up A Notch</h4>

<p>Ow, my spirit! Look, last night was a mistake. Fry! Stay back! He's too
powerful!</p>

<ol> 
<li>Oh yeah, good luck with that.</li> 
<li>You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?</li> 
<li>Yeah, lots of people did.</li> 
<li>Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</li> 
<li>Ow, my spirit!</li> 
</ol>

<h5>Fry and the Slurm Factory</h5>

<p>Meh. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared&hellip; But I've
never been to the moon!</p> 

<p>I'm Santa Claus! I wish! It's a nickel. Hey,
whatcha watching? I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be
feared&hellip;</p>

<h2>The Duh-Vinci Code</h2>

<p>Ow, my spirit! What are their names? Say it in Russian!</p>

<ul> 
<li>Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the
phrase "upside your head."</li> 
<li>You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!</li> 
</ul>

<h3>How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back</h3>

<p>Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold
the charge and the reception isn't very&hellip; You guys realize you live in a
sewer, right? No, she'll probably make me do it. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I
will 'destroy' you! No, I'm Santa Claus!</p>

<h4>Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles</h4>

<p>Also Zoidberg. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant!  Your lyrics lack
subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes
me feel angry! Yeah, lots of people did.</p>

<ol> 
<li>Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery
can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very&hellip;</li> 
<li>Guards!  Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!</li> 
</ol> 

<h5>The Why of Fry</h5>

<p>Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as
"the brig". Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred
to as "the brig". You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Leela, are you
alright? You got wanged on the head. Look, last night was a mistake. I just want
to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.</p>

<h6>Where No Fan Has Gone Before</h6>

<p>You can see how I lived before I met you. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a
third time! But that would be it. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE
GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! I guess because my parents keep
telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Yeah, lots of people did.</p>

<p>Shut up and take my money! File not found. With gusto.</p>

<p>Hey, whatcha watching? Hello, little man. I will destroy you! No! The kind
with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Quite possible. We live long and
are celebrated poopers.</p>

<p>You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Stop! Don't shoot fire stick
in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Hey, tell me something. You've
got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your
laundry?</p>

<p>Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! You'll
have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!
Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Bender, you
risked your life to save me! We don't have a brig. A sexy mistake.</p>

<p>I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm
going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at
Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! You've
killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me
the death penalty? Oh sure! Blame the wizards!</p>

<p>Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. Good
man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Fetal
stemcells, aren't those controversial? Fatal. Oh yeah, good luck with that.</p>

<p>Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?
Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote
alcoholic beverages! That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Fry! Stay
back! He's too powerful! I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit
0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and
he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.</p>

<p>Look, last night was a mistake. Why would a robot need to drink? Hey, tell me
something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're
doing your laundry? Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to
classical music. Large bet on myself in round one. Oh, how awful. Did he at
least die painlessly? &hellip;To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding
up? &hellip;To shreds, you say.</p>

<p>I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. No, I'm Santa Claus!
I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were
there, and you were there! Daylight and everything. No, of course not. It
was&hellip; uh&hellip; porno. Yeah, that's it.</p>

<p>Yeah, lots of people did. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you
screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.
But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.</p>

<p>I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!
Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Meh.
Can I use the gun?</p>

<p>But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I usually try to keep my
sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. But I've
never been to the moon! What kind of a father would I be if I said no? And from
now on you're all named Bender Jr. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't
rock.</p>

<p>Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me
with my sexual inhibitions? You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with
all the bed making you'll be doing. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a
crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Hey, guess what you're
accessories to. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Now
that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my
sexual inhibitions?</p>

<p>You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of
Jesus? Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs
while we're at it? I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed
up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.</p>
